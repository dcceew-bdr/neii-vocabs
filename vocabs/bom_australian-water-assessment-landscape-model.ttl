    skos:definition "Actual Evapotranspiration is an estimate of the total evapotranspiration from vegetation, soil and groundwater. Water is evaporated directly from the canopy interception, the upper soil water store and the groundwater store. In addition water is withdrawn by transpiration from the lower soil water store, the deep soil water store and the groundwater store. The evaporation from canopy uses the event-based approach of Gash (1979) and the Van Dijk and Bruijnzeel (2001) modification for sparse canopies. Evaporation from groundwater occurs only in those saturated parts of the landscape where the water table intersects the surface. Soil evaporation depends on the moisture content of the upper layer for the unsaturated parts of the landscape. The actual transpiration is limited by a potential transpiration rate and a maximum root water uptake. Actual evapotranspiration is not well represented in major urban areas due to a current lack of impervious layers in the Hydrological Response Units (HRU). Similarly, the estimated actual evapotranspiration for irrigation areas and open water needs to be taken with caution due to the current lack of irrigated crops and waterbodies in the HRU."@en ;

The maximum storage within the soil layer is calculated from the depth of the soil and the relative soil water storage capacity. The soil properties of the deep soil layer are indirectly derived from ASRIS based on the lower soil layer properties. In this case it is assumed that the bulk density of the deep soil is higher than the lower soil and so the relative available water capacity is lower. The 6 m bottom boundary of the deep soil layer is based on the assumption that the deep rooted vegetation can access water down to 6 m. Only the deep rooted vegetation can access the deep soil moisture. The Actual soil moisture grids estimate the percentage of available water content rather than total soil water volume.

    skos:definition "Runoff represents a modelled estimate expected from a small unimpaired catchment. It is produced from surface runoff, baseflow and interflow for each grid cell. Surface runoff is a combination of infiltration excess runoff and saturation excess runoff. The baseflow depends on groundwater storage and deep drainage from the deep soil store. The interflow term represents the sum of the total discharge to the stream from the upper and lower soil stores in each grid cell. The Bureau’s operational AWRA-L model is currently calibrated on a continental scale against streamflow observations and satellite based actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture. Hillslope processes are not simulated; there is no lateral flow between grid cells. Similarly, there is no routing technique used in AWRA-L. The estimated runoff for major urban areas should not be used due to lack of impervious layers in the Hydrological Response Units (HRU) of AWRA-L. The estimated runoff numbers for irrigation areas and open water storages (lakes) also needs to be used with caution due to lack of irrigated crops and waterbodies in the HRU."@en ;
