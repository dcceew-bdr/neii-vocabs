    skos:definition """Climate and weather are both components of meteorology.

In brief: the weather of any place refers to the atmospheric variables for a brief period of time. Climate, however, represents the atmospheric conditions for a long period of time, and generally refers to the normal or mean course of the weather. Climate can now be expanded to include the future expectation of long term weather, in the order of weeks, months or years ahead.

A more detailed definition from the Meteorological Glossary published by the U.K. Meteorological Office is:

The climate of a locality is the synthesis of the day-to-day values of the meteorological elements that affect the locality.

Synthesis here implies more than simple averaging. Various methods are used to represent climate, e.g. both average and extreme values, frequencies of values within stated ranges, frequencies of weather types with associated values of elements. The main climatic elements are precipitation, temperature, humidity, sunshine, wind velocity, and such phenomena as fog, frost, thunder, gale; cloudiness, grass minimum temperature, and soil temperature at various depths may also be included. Climatic data are usually expressed in terms of an individual calendar month or season and are determined over a period (usually about 30 years) long enough to ensure that representative values for the month or season are obtained."""@en ;

When the sun's energy reaches the earth some of it is reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed. The absorbed energy warms both the atmosphere and the earth's surface, both of which then emit heat back toward space as long-wave radiation. This outgoing long-wave radiation is partially trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and water vapour which then radiate the energy in all directions, further warming the Earth's surface and the lower levels of the atmosphere. Without these greenhouse gases the Earth's average surface temperature would be about 33 degrees Celsius cooler.

The enhanced greenhouse effect refers to the addition of more heat trapping gases to the atmosphere. The extra greenhouse gases are not 'natural' in origin, and are primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas), with smaller contributions from land use changes, such as land clearing. The increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are contributing to a warming of the earth's surface."""@en ;

    skos:definition """One useful way of representing rainfall across a wide area like Australia is in terms of percentages of a mean rainfall over some base period. Percentages between 0% and 100% indicate lower than average rainfalls, while percentages greater than 100% indicate higher than average rainfalls. In some northern parts of the country, dry season rainfalls are often very low, and weeks or even months may go by without any rainfall being recorded. In these places and times of the year, the monthly rainfalls may be below average (that is, percentages less than 100%) in rather more than 50% of years.

The percentage of mean rainfall maps (http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/awap/rain/index.jsp?colour=colour&time=latest&step=0&map=percent&period=daily&area=nat) on the Bureau of Meteorology's web site are all generated from monthly means calculated for each calendar month using the years 1961 to 1990.

Note that the month to date rainfall percentages maps compare the rainfall recorded in the month to date with the mean rainfall for the entire month. Consequently early in the month, the rainfall percentages will typically be quite low, unless the rainfall is unusually heavy at the start of the month.

Likewise, the year to date rainfall percentages maps compare the rainfall recorded in the year to date with the mean rainfall for the entire year.

The southern wet season is defined as the months April to November (inclusive). The southern wet season to date rainfall percentages compare the rainfall recorded in the southern wet season to date (that is, since the start of April) with the mean rainfall for the entire season.

The northern wet season is defined as the months October to April (inclusive). The northern wet season to date rainfall percentages compare the rainfall recorded in the northern wet season to date in a manner analogous to those for the southern wet season.

It is quite difficult to tell from a rainfall percentages map if the rainfall has been highest or lowest on record. To see how the rainfall in the current period compares with previous years, the rainfall deciles maps should be consulted."""@en ;

The terms serious and severe are defined by -

. Serious rainfall deficiency: rainfall lies above the lowest five per cent of recorded rainfall but below the lowest ten per cent (decile range 1) for the period in question,
. Severe rainfall deficiency: rainfall is among the lowest five per cent for the period in question.
Areas where the rainfall is lowest on record for the given time period are also shown.

Defining the end of a period of rainfall deficiency is a difficult matter, and presents more problems than defining the start. However, the following definitions which were used in the days of hand-drawn analyses, still provide useful guidance as to whether there has been significant relief from a period of rainfall deficit. They are only applicable to periods of about 12 months or less, and great care in their interpretation is needed in those areas which have a distinct wet and dry season in the annual rainfall cycle.

    skos:definition """The Southern Oscillation Index, or SOI, gives an indication of the development and intensity of El Niño or La Niña events in the Pacific Ocean. The SOI is calculated using the pressure differences between Tahiti and Darwin.

Sustained negative values of the SOI below −7 often indicate El Niño episodes. These negative values are usually accompanied by sustained warming of the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, a decrease in the strength of the Pacific Trade Winds, and a reduction in winter and spring rainfall over much of eastern Australia and the Top End. You can read more about historical El Niño events and their effect on Australia in the Detailed analysis of past El Niño events (http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/enlist/).

Sustained positive values of the SOI above +7 are typical of a La Niña episode. they are associated with stronger Pacific trade winds and warmer sea temperatures to the north of Australia. Waters in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become cooler during this time. Together these give an increased probability that eastern and northern Australia will be wetter than normal. You can read more about historical La Niña events and their effect on Australia in the Detailed analysis of past La Niña events (http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/lnlist/).

The ENSO Wrap-Up (http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/) includes the latest 30-day SOI value, as well as other information on indicators of El Niño and La Niña events."""@en ;
