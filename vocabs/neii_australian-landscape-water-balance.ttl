    skos:definition "Deep drainage is an estimate of the water that drains from the bottom of the deep soil layer (6 m) into the groundwater stores. Soil drainage and moisture dynamics are based on water balance considerations for each layer, and unsaturated downward movement of water under gravity only. There is assumed to be no lateral drainage from the deep soil layer. Drainage from each layer is subject to limits imposed by water availability and hydraulic conductivity. Deep Drainage generally describes diffuse groundwater recharge."@en ;

    skos:definition """Deep Soil Moisture represents the percentage of available water content between 1 m and 6 m in the soil profile. The maximum storage within the soil layer is calculated from the depth of the soil and the relative soil water storage capacity. The soil properties of the deep soil layer are indirectly derived from ASRIS based on the lower soil layer properties. In this case it is assumed that the bulk density of the deep soil is higher than the lower soil and so the relative available water capacity is lower. The 6 m bottom boundary of the deep soil layer is based on the assumption that the deep rooted vegetation can access water down to 6 m. Only the deep rooted vegetation can access the deep soil moisture. 

Actual soil moisture grids estimate the percentage of available water content rather than total soil water volume. Relative soil moisture grids, like the other grids, represent the long term deciles."""@en ;
